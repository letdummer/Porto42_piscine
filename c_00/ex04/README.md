### 1. `int main(void)`
```
int main(void)
{
    ft_is_negative(-1);
    return (0);
}
```
- This is the definition of the `main` function, where the program execution begins.
- Inside `main`, the function `ft_is_negative(-1);` is called with `-1` as the argument. This will check if `-1` is negative.
- `return (0);` indicates that the program executed successfully (This is a good coding practice.). 

### 2. `void ft_is_negative(int n)`
```
void ft_is_negative(int n)
{
    char result;

    if (n >= 0)
        result = 'P';
    else
        result = 'N';
    write(1, &result, 1);
}
```
- This defines the `ft_is_negative` function, which takes one parameter, an integer `n`.
- **`char result;`** This declares a variable named `result` of type `char`. This variable will store the result to be printed (either 'P' or 'N') based on the value of `n`.

### 3. Conditional Check
```
if (n >= 0)
    result = 'P';
else
    result = 'N';
```

This conditional statement checks the value of `n`:
  * If `n` is greater than or equal to `0`, it assigns the character `'P'` to `result`. This indicates that `n` is positive or zero.
  * If `n` is less than `0`, it assigns the character `'N'` to `result`. This indicates that `n` is negative.

### 4. Output the Result
```c
write(1, &result, 1);
```
- This line uses the `write()` function to output the value of `result` to the terminal:
  - `1` is the file descriptor for standard output (the terminal).
  - `&result` is the address of the variable `result`, allowing `write()` to access the character.
  - `1` specifies that one byte (the character) should be written to the output.

*Output*
>`N`
