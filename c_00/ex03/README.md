### 1. `int main(void)`
```
int main(void)
{
    ft_print_numbers();
}
```
- This is the definition of the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.
- Inside `main`, the `ft_print_numbers()` function is called, which will execute the logic to print the numbers.

### 2. `void ft_print_numbers(void)`
```
void ft_print_numbers(void)
{
    char numbers;
    numbers = '0';
    while (numbers <= '9')
    {
        write(1, &numbers, 1);
        numbers++;
    }
}
```
- This defines the `ft_print_numbers` function.
- **`char numbers;`**: This declares a variable named `numbers` of type `char`, which will be used to iterate through the characters representing the digits.
- **`numbers = '0';`**: This initializes `numbers` to the character `'0'`, which is the starting point for printing numeric characters.

### 3. `while (numbers <= '9')`

- This `while` loop continues executing as long as `numbers` is less than or equal to the character `'9'`.
- This condition ensures that the loop will iterate through each digit from `'0'` to `'9'`.

### 4. Inside the While Loop
```
{
    write(1, &numbers, 1);
    numbers++;
}
```
- **`write(1, &numbers, 1);`**
  
  - `1` is the file descriptor for standard output (the terminal).
  - `&numbers` is the address of the variable `numbers`, allowing `write()` to access the character.
  - `1` specifies that one byte (the current digit) should be written to the output.
 

- **`numbers++;`** After writing the current digit, this increments `numbers` to the next character in the ASCII table. For example, if `numbers` is `'0'`, it becomes `'1'`, and so on, until it reaches `'9'`.

*Output*
>`0123456789`
